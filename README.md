 hello I love coding

 Done by Mervyn, Dexter, Matthew, Sven


To whoever is reading this, here is the general story
Hoe ming wei's grp used starter bootstrap, so sb just mean the bootstrap
He then used the sample flask project from the frrecodecamp for SQL stuff
He made the website to be like a banking system, hence the deposit and transfer

Original version is the one at iamsven2005/flask repo, it is curently on replit


Our idea is to make it work like we are actually ding for a company so that we can use it the portfolio for a business sample.

A few feature were added on the flask repo:
Retail, warranty, fixed many bugs, realised it was intended for a ctf

Risky branch is recommended for risky stuff.

Tips:
Presentation, focus on admin side
Week 13: CRUD for all memebers ( try to integrate), have more than 2 bs templates
(go to boostrap websites to pirate source code in a test file)

Week 15: Validation messages (make sure there are messages)
Week 18: Think of the story line

If possible, refactor the code before running, run main.py, temp runner is for turning off werkzeug

Make base.html your default, and based your bootstrap template

Hope this helps!
